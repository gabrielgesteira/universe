Setup for R-universe

If you want to change which packages or package versions are listed on our [R-universe site](https://polyploids.r-universe.dev),
please edit the packages.json file.  URLs must point to a Git repository, but it can be on any site (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
See https://github.com/r-universe-org/demo-registry/blob/master/packages.json for an example.  If your default branch is not
guaranteed to be functional, you can use `branch` to point to a stable branch or release.

Please feel free to add any R packages pertinent to the molecular breeding of polyploid crops.
